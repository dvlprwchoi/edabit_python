# Simon Says

Create a function that takes in two lists and returns True if the second list follows the first list by one element, and False otherwise. In other words, determine if the second list is the first list shifted to the right by 1.

Examples
simon_says([1, 2], [5, 1]) ➞ True

simon_says([1, 2], [5, 5]) ➞ False

simon_says([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]) ➞ True

simon_says([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [5, 5, 1, 2, 3]) ➞ False
Notes
Both input lists will be of the same length, and will have a minimum length of 2.
The values of the 0-indexed element in the second list and the n-1th indexed element in the first list do not matter.
