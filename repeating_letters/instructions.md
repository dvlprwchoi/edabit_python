# Repeating Letters

Create a function that takes a string and returns a string in which each character is repeated once.

Examples
double_char("String") ➞ "SSttrriinngg"

double_char("Hello World!") ➞ "HHeelllloo WWoorrlldd!!"

double*char("1234!* ") ➞ "11223344!!\_\_ "
Notes
All test cases contain valid strings. Don't worry about spaces, special characters or numbers. They're all considered valid characters.
